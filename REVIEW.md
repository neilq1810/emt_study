# Depth & Technical-Review Tracker

Collaborative deepen-and-review pass. Each chapter moves
`DRAFT → DEEPENED → REVIEWED (by user) → VERIFIED`. We are working through
**Part VII–IX (Ch. 19–25) first**, then by agreement.

## Conventions for the deep pass
- Add: full derivations, worked numerical examples (tie to `simulations/` where
  possible), failure-mode boxes, quantitative trade tables, and **new primary
  citations** (searched, not recalled).
- Keep the per-claim `(conf: …)` tags and the per-chapter open-questions list.
- After each chapter: commit, then summarize *what was added / what's uncertain*
  for user review.

(Other chapters remain DRAFT; will be scheduled next.)

## Flagged for upcoming chapter passes
- ✅ **DONE (Ch. 17 deepened):** electrical-safety contrast between
  **biased sensors (TMR/MR, Hall, fluxgate) and passive coils** in patient-applied
  EMT tools. A passive coil carries no power at the patient end (only the induced
  µV EMF), so leakage/shock risk and isolation are minimal. A *biased* sensor
  needs DC bias + a stable reference delivered to the sensor at/near the body →
  active conductors carrying power into a Type CF applied part: patient-leakage
  limits (10/50 µA), single-fault analysis of the bias rail, tip self-heating, and
  galvanic-isolation of the bias supply all become first-order (IEC 60601-1).
  Tie to Ch. 14.3 (TMR bias) and Ch. 25 (bias-reference noise). [user-requested]
