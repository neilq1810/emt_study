- **RESEARCH** — sources gathered, outline of claims drafted.
- **DRAFT** — prose written, citations attached.
- **REVIEWED** — technical correctness, equations, and history checked against
  sources; open questions logged.
- **VERIFIED** — every claim cites a verifiable source; contradictions noted.

> **Digital-twin Part rationale.** Emerged from the "5 of 10 companies fail" gap analysis:
> the twin is the **integrative methodology** that converts the book's *understanding* into
> a build → calibrate → validate → monitor workflow, closing (as *method*, not values) the
> calibration, noise-floor, and in-situ-distortion gaps and partially the system-integration
> gap. Ch. 53 is the proof-of-concept opener; Ch. 54–57 are scoped, not yet drafted.

> **All technical Parts (II–XIV) now drafted.** Remaining prose: Part I Ch.2
> (patent/academic genealogy) & Ch.3 (timelines/trees). Then non-prose phases:
> figures (4), simulations (5), website (6), cross-ref (7), review (8), final (9).

## Gap-closure plan (Definitive-Reference Review)

Derived from the hostile expert-board gap analysis in
[`GAP-ANALYSIS.md`](GAP-ANALYSIS.md). The book's quantitative spine (Parts II–X)
is strong; the gaps are **additive**. We work **tier by tier**. Each item lists a
**proposed placement** (new Part letter, or "expand Ch. X"); final chapter numbers
are assigned when each is created (as for Ch. 32–37). State: ⬜ todo · 🟡 in progress
· 🟢 drafted/deepened · ✅ reviewed.

### Tier 1 — BLOCKING (must close before any "definitive" claim)
The single highest-leverage cluster is the **differential/registration/motion
pillar** (T1.1–T1.4): clinical EMT is a *differential, registered, motion-gated*
measurement and the book currently models only absolute generator-frame tracking.

> Proposed **Part XIX — Differential Tracking, Registration & Motion** (T1.1–T1.5, T1.7)
> and **Part XX — Dependability & Compliance** (T1.8–T1.10).

- [x] **T1.6** Wireless & Passive Tracking: Resonant LC Transponders (Calypso), backscatter, FM *(Part XXI, Ch. 47)* — 🟢 DEEPENED: passive LC transponder principle (excite→ring-down→re-radiate, dipole inverse from external array via reciprocity); resonant freq/time-selective clutter rejection (ring-down τ~Q/πf₀ vs eddy settling); Calypso (3 beacons, 10 Hz, ~1–2 mm, radiotherapy); active-vs-passive-vs-backscatter; physics-already-here (Ch.5/6/19/23/27.7); reliability win (no wire/connector, Ch.44) vs 1/d⁶ signal cost & position-only. +balter2005/willoughby2006. **[done — TIER 1 COMPLETE]**

- [x] **T1.10** Human Factors & Usability Engineering (IEC 62366) *(Part XX, Ch. 46)* — 🟢 DEEPENED: human-in-the-loop (correct pose can still harm via use error); EMT use-error table (automation bias, mode confusion, accepted mis-registration, missed dropout, alarm fatigue, setup, workaround); **trust calibration** (Parasuraman misuse/disuse; over-trust→wrong-site, under-trust→fluoro/radiation); **display uncertainty not false precision** (error ellipsoid/TRE; detect-and-flag works only if the human perceives it); IEC 62366 process + summative validation; use error = design defect. +iec62366/parasuraman1997. **[done — Part XX complete]**

### Cross-cutting workstreams (not chapters — run alongside the tiers)
- 🟢 **X1 — Credibility/verification pass.** *Largely done.* Built a runnable
  verifier (`scripts/verify_manuscript.py`): citation integrity, figure/data reference
  existence, chapter cross-ref range, placeholder scan, and a curated **sim↔prose number
  contract** — **PASS** (100/100 citations resolve, 0 broken, 0 dangling, 0 placeholders,
  7/7 sim numbers in sync). Web-corroborated and corrected: **mr_capsule** (Wang/Meng/Hu,
  *EMBS'06* pp. 2522–2525, PMID 17946518 — **year fixed 2008→2006**); **birkfellner1998**
  (Med Phys 25(11):2242–2248, DOI 10.1118/1.598425, PMID 9829253; 9-author list fixed);
  and the **Ch. 28 acquisitions** (Roper–NDI Jun 2011, NDI–Ascension 2012, J&J–Biosense
  29 Sep 1997 ~\$400M, Covidien–superDimension ~\$300M 2012, Medtronic–Covidien
  26 Jan 2015 ~\$50B). Confirmed the **Ch. 31/33/34/37 illustrative budgets are honestly
  labeled** (conf-tagged; back-with-sim is X3, not X1). Remaining (minor): Ascension \$19M
  & Biosense-1993 founding (single-source); pulsed-DC eq. 27.1 prefactor; §33.5 metrology
  vendor specs — each appropriately hedged.
- [ ] **X2 — Mathematics-depth upgrades (Section E)** woven into the owning chapters
  (6-DOF FIM, nonlinear observability, TRE theory, manifold solve, GP distortion).
- 🟡 **X3 — Simulation/figure backing.** Done: 6-DOF FIM (sim10), **deep-volume CRLB +
  moment lever** (sim11: σ∝1/m_t, z_max∝m_t^0.25 → 16× moment = 2× depth), **dynamic-
  distortion flag-ROC** (sim12: detection margin geometry-dependent +0.56%…−0.26%, NEGATIVE
  for pose-mimicking distortion → single residual flag necessary-but-not-sufficient). 12 sims,
  9 computed figures, sim↔prose contract at 9 assertions. Remaining: schematic diagrams; more
  figure coverage.
- [ ] **X4 — Consolidation & cross-reference pass (Phase 7).** Integrate Parts
  XV–XX into the narrative; audit every `Ch. X §Y` and `[@key]`; convert in-chapter
  "open questions" from a to-do list into resolved text or a single tracked appendix.

### Recommended working sequence
1. **T1.1 → T1.3 → T1.4** (the differential/registration/motion pillar — the verdict-breaking gap), then **T1.5, T1.7**.
2. **T1.8 → T1.9 → T1.10** (dependability/compliance) + **T1.6** (wireless transponders).
3. **X1 credibility pass** (cheap, high-trust-yield) once Tier 1 lands.
4. Tier 2 by cluster (math T2.3–T2.4; clinical T2.16–T2.17, T2.24–T2.26; industry T2.5–T2.13).
5. **X4 consolidation/cross-ref**, then Tier 3, then Phases 4–9.



Captured from working sessions so they are not lost; none of these are built yet.

1. **Characterization rig — accuracy map & explorer (Ch. 33).** Phase-5 sim of an
   accuracy-vs-position map over the working volume; Phase-6 "characterization
   explorer" tool with a rig-floor calculator (GT ⊕ registration ⊕ thermal vs the
   DUT spec, the 5–10× rule), tying to the CRLB / working-volume tools.
2. **Pulsed-DC settling (Ch. 27 §27.6).** Phase-5 sim of the step-vs-AC eddy
   amplitude for a sphere to pin the eq. 27.1 O(1) prefactor; a "pulsed-DC settling"
   dashboard slider (wait t_s → suppression S = e^(t_s/τ_e) vs update rate).
3. **Transmitter-side sensing (Ch. 27 §27.7).** Phase-5 sim of the reflected-
   impedance signature (eq. 27.2) vs distorter size/distance/material; a toggle in
   the distortion dashboard to show the transmitter-side observable alongside the
   receiver-side error.
4. **Error-budget grounding (Ch. 31 / error-budget dashboard).** Tolerance
   Monte-Carlo + a measured/simulated distortion-residual map to replace the
   illustrative deterministic & environmental columns with sim-backed defaults.
5. **Witness-sensor compensation (Ch. 27).** Interactive demo + Phase-5 sim of
   residual vs. witness count/placement (pre-existing Ch. 27 open item).

## Research quality control

**Citation keys.** In-text citations use `[@key]` where `key` matches an `id`
in `citations/bibliography.json`.

**Confidence tags.** Claims that are not textbook-standard carry an inline
confidence marker:
- `(conf: high)` — multiple independent peer-reviewed/primary sources agree.
- `(conf: med)` — single authoritative source, or vendor-reported.
- `(conf: low)` — inferred, contested, or based on secondary reporting; treat
  as provisional.

**Source-type tags** recorded per bibliography entry: `journal`, `conference`,
`dissertation`, `standard`, `patent`, `regulatory`, `vendor`, `lab`, `gov`.

**Open questions.** Each chapter ends with an "Open questions / to verify"
section. Items there are *not yet* `VERIFIED`.

## Known scope risks / honesty notes
- Many vendor performance numbers are self-reported and measured under
  non-standardized conditions; they are tagged `(conf: med)` or lower and
  cross-checked against independent assessment studies (e.g., Hummel protocol).
- Patent priority dates vs. publication dates are distinguished where known.
- Some early/military history is documented only in secondary sources; flagged.
